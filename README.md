# awesome-secure-computation [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

This repo is a paper summary for cryptography-based secure computation papers (I prefer published papers ðŸ˜›), including topics like [*Multiparty Computation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation), [*Homomorphic Encryption (or Lattice)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption) and [*Differential Privacy*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy). If you are looking for hardware solutions like Trusted Platform Module (TPM), or Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), I'm sorry this repo is not what you're looking for :(.

Here's a good place to ask questions about cryptography/cryptanalysis, or answering one (if you are capable of doing so): [https://crypto.stackexchange.com/](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/), and finding papers [Cryptology ePrint Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/).
